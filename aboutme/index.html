      <h1>Hello! My name is David Vega</h1>
      <p>I'm 23 years old, I'm from Costa Rica and I love music and videogames! I'm currently working in a job not related to programming or IT, but I hope to find a new job soon that will help me get some experience in the way. I have already studied a bit of programming before, but it was several years ago, so I'm up to any challenge! I hope to enjoy the course and have a lot of fun!</p>
